# Quizzy
- Quizzy Library while using classic design patterns: Singleton,  Factory, Prototype, Builder and Data Access Object.
- This library allows the user to create a quiz in two options: GUI or TERMINAL.
- When the user has chosen the type of quiz he wants to create, he provides a name to the quiz, creates questions for the quiz where each question contains a title, the question itself and 5 possible answers which 
  one of them is correct.
- Once the quiz is created, the user can save it to a csv file, and can also load it.
- When the user runs the program, he can choose the answers to the questions, and at the end of the quiz he can click submit and get a score on it.
- The project includes unit tests developed with JUnit.
